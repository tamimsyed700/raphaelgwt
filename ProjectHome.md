## What does it do? ##
RaphaelGWT is a library that allows you to use [Raphaël](http://www.raphaeljs.com/) in your GWT application.  Raphaël is a lightweight JavaScript library for cross-platform vector graphics that uses SVG in browsers that support it, and Microsoft VML on Internet Explorer.

## How does it work? ##
RaphaelGWT provides two fundamental classes: (1) **RaphaelJS**, a [JavaScript Overlay Type](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCodingBasicsOverlay.html) that provides a zero-overhead interface to the underlying JavaScript API, and (2) **Raphael**, a [GWT Widget](http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/Widget.html) that wraps the overlay with a more Java-friendly API that will operate side-by-side with other GWT Widgets.

## Why does it exist? ##
RaphaelGWT was originally created for rendering interactive database diagrams in a product named _Hydro4GE_.  Hydro4GE, Inc. graciously donated RaphaelGWT to the open source community after this work was mentioned in an [article](http://googlewebtoolkit.blogspot.com/2009/09/hydro4ge-paas-built-with-gwt.html) written by Geoff Speicher on the GWT Blog.  Hydro4GE has since been re-branded as **[Pario](http://www.getpario.com/)**, which has a [free trial](https://www.getpario.com/trial/signup/) where you can see a demo of RaphaelGWT in action.
